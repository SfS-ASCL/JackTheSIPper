This directory holds the subdirs:

- xsd: XSDs from the CLARIN component registry for all relevant profiles
- instances: xml-based instantiations of each profile

and the conversion script 'convertAll.js'.

Steps to generate JSON variants of 

1. open an XSD in Oxygen to generate a sample XML file (with optionals)
   ./instances
   
2. call the conversion script to generate JSON variants (in directory ../conversionScript):
   node convertAll.js

3. To get Oxygen to validate the XML that results from BagSaver, the results from step 2 need to be manually edited.

- remove all references to id000
- remove many attributes
- replace references to local versions (schemaLocation) to profiles manually...
(maybe step2 can be enhaned do these edits automatically in the future...)
