1. get the latest CMDI 1.2 schemas from CLARIN component registry (XSD)
   ./xsd
   
2. open an XSD in Oxygen to generate a sample XML file (with optionals)
   ./instance_xml
   
3. use Oxygen to generate JSON for sample XML file
   ./instance_json

4. the JSON instances are then manipulated by Jack The SIPPER for CMDI construction
